I am quite new to the USA and trying to understand and figure out how to fit into this completely new world. Surprisingly, before arriving I had many misconceptions in my head that I got from films and news. As I have discovered, the best way to fight misconceptions is through data analysis. For instance, it was interesting to learn what kinds of industries are present in the US and what people are doing for a living. To find this, I scraped the most recent (2022) dataset by Forbes on America’s Best Employers. I picked this one because I like companies with happy employees. Here I would like to present you my public Tableau dashboard dissecting this dataset <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tatyana.pichugina/viz/Listofbestemployers/Dashboard1?publish=yes">link</a>.

Before the analysis, I thought that most of the happy employees work for IT. This is not true, the IT industry is quite small and takes only 14th place by the total number of happy employees. The 1st place is the US government companies, 2nd place is Retail and Wholesale companies and 3rd place is Health Care companies.

Looking at the cars on the streets, I have detected that most of them are from Japanese brands such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and just a few by Ford. I thought that the Automotive industry is non-existent in the USA. I was wrong again. Honda is on this list with 200K employees, Toyota has 170K employees, and Nissan has 130K. Brands are originally Japanese but this workforce is in the US.

Surprisingly, companies from the happy employee list are big and mature, they generally have over 20K employees and are older than 50 years. The exceptions from the trend are companies from the Education industry (Universities) that have less than 10K employees and companies from IT and Media industries that are less than 50 years old.

Thank you for reading!
