#### Work Experience
*Machine Learning Engineer (Computer vision) | Invonto, USA | Feb 2023 - present*
* Orchestrated end-to-end machine learning projects: established business oriented performance
metrics, initiated image dataset collection, performed data labeling, executed iterative model
experimentation, deployed and monitor model.
* Significantly enhanced model performance in semantic segmentation by optimizing deep neural
networks (U-Net), achieving an exceptional increase in Intersection over Union (IOU) from 0.76 to
0.90. Employed PyTorch Lightning as a dynamic training framework to drive these advancements
effectively.
* Successfully deployed a trained model utilizing Flask as a web application on an EC2 instance in
AWS, ensuring efficient and user-friendly access to the model's capabilities.
* Gathered, curated and refined image datasets, resulting in improved model generalization and
accuracy.
* Employed advanced computer vision techniques to accurately measure objects within images
utilizing OpenCV
* Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to integrate machine learning
solutions into practical applications
* Applied best practices in version control and documentation, providing transparent and
well-structured project documentation that facilitates knowledge sharing and ensures project
reproducibility.



*Senior Researcher | Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Germany | 2018 - 2022*
* Mined, analyzed and interpreted over 100 Tb unstructured data (microscopy videorecording) for 3
decision-making research projects with multiple stakeholders.
* Checked data quality and data collection problems using SQL, and Python API for Omero Server
Database.
* Designed Python (Jupyter) pipeline to check data quality, clean, and segment objects for
thousands of microscopy images, to facilitate data analysis and reduce hundreds of hours of manual
work.
* Detected anomalies in instrumental data collection, identified the problem and developed an
automated Python script to check the experimental setup.
* Identified meaningful clusters using Scikit-learn Gaussian Mixture Model combined with PCA.
Tracked version changes and shared code for 3 projects using Git and GitLab.
* Led Image processing discussion group for institute members, organized talks, invited guest
speakers, and managed surveys.


*Researcher | the University of Auckland, New Zealand | 2012 - 2016*
* Designed from scratch a 3D predictive model using the Monte Carlo simulation method for whole
yeast genomes using C.
* Performed over 3000 extensive calculations using Auckland University Supercomputer (NESI) using
SLURM, and Linux.
* Identified meaningful clusters of genetic elements in 3D genomes data set using R.
* Conducted statistical analysis for over 1000 3D genome structures.
* Designed 3D visualizations of genes, epigenetic marks, and replication origins positions using R.
* Published 3 papers in peer-reviewed journals (NAR, Scientific Reports, Nucleus) in collaboration
with interdisciplinary cross-country research teams.
* Performed literature search and summarized findings for over 300 scientific papers.
* Gave 3 presentations at international conferences.
